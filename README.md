#Description

This plugin offers a convenient way to reference ReqeustTracker tickets.

Instead of using absolute links to tickets, you can use common short-hand RT####, where #### equals the Ticket Number

##Usage

Link to a particular ticket, just use the string RT####, where ####=your ticket number.

You can also link to Request Tracker articles: RTA####, where ####=your article number.

##Configuration

Set the $rtlink_root_url in lib/plugins/rtlink/syntax.php to the root of your Request Tracker installation.

Enjoy!
